Web application to easen shared playlist creation and customization in Spotify.

  

Blendify allows its users to create rooms where other users can join. On these rooms, each user will be prompted to select a song-selection mode, from:

  

- Specific playlist songs

- Most listened-to songs

- Custom mood songs

- Spotify recommendations

  

When the song-selection mode is selected and other parameters are set, the user can filter the selected songs list before adding them to the shared playlist.

  

The application is made with Meteor and React.
